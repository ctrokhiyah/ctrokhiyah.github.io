# Bioprocess: from shaker to bioreactor

Media selection - high yield
Choose of system in which our microorganism comfortable
Oxygen - limited factor
Agitation - to enhance oxygen transfer in the culture
Heat - cooling is important
pH 
Metabolic process must be kept stable
Shake in bioreactor - optimal condition for growth
nutrient and oxygen supply
Shaker 
Bioreactor - oxygen is supply using sparger and strirring
temperature stabilisation - bioreactor control
Feeding control
Adequate downstream process - purifying products

Setup bioreactor, monitoring, control,
